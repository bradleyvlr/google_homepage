# google_homepage
I am rebuilding the Google homepage for the Odin Project

I am in the process of learning web development because it seems like a good career choice for me. I am enjoying the hell out of learning this stuff and am regretting a little bit the decision to go to college. I suppose I shouldn't start regretting that until I am a little bit further into learning this stuff.
